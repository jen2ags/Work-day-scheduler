# Work-day-scheduler

## Purpose
To provide a scheduler for the work day. The user will be able to input tasks to be completed at a specific time and save these tasks so that if they come back to the page and reload, the task will still be saved to their scheduler. The scheduler will also display colors depending on the time of day and if that time on the scheduler is in the past, present or future.
